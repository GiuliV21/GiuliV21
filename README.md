- 👋 Hi, I'm @GiuliV21
- 👀 I am interested in the programming and the database
- 🌱I'm currently learning mySql, full stack python.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate in any field that is fruitful, for me and for the person who has the problem. For example, today I am participating in CET, where I am designing an app that helps with a social problem, I chose Education, because I am from Argentina and the great dropout of students that occurred due to the pandemic affects me a lot. I consider this a fruitful project for me and for society.
